# Conversational AI Turn-Taking Model
This project aims to develop a Conversational AI Turn-Taking Model for Althea Health's phone call report portal, enhancing the natural flow and efficiency of interactions between human users and AI systems. By predicting the optimal moments for AI turn-taking, the project addresses the challenge of creating seamless and considerate conversations in real-time environments.

## Introduction
Utilizing the advanced capabilities of transformer-based models, this project focuses on implementing a DistilBERT-based architecture to predict turn transitions in conversations. The model outputs a continuous score indicating the confidence level that a human user has completed their turn, making it a groundbreaking step towards naturalizing AI-human interactions in healthcare communication portals.

## Goals and objective
To develop systems that handle turn-taking as naturally and efficiently as humans.
To enable the system to handle interruptions gracefully, respond in a timely manner, and adapt to various cultural norms.

## Tools and libraries used
Language: Python

Libraries: Transformers (Hugging Face), Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Plot

Models: DistilBERT for sequence classification, evaluated against alternatives like GPT-2 for contextual performance.
